## Usage

1. Each chapter has its own package
2. Each package contains example files demonstrating key concepts
3. Run individual example files to see output
4. Add your own examples as you study each chapter

## Current Progress

- [x] Chapter 14: I/O (In Progress)
- [ ] Other chapters (to be added as you study)

## Tips for Studying

1. Run each example and observe the output
2. Modify examples to test edge cases
3. Add your own examples based on practice questions
4. Use the README in each chapter for quick reference
5. Create test files to practice different scenarios

## Exam Topics Covered by Chapter

### Chapter 14: I/O
- Understanding Files and Directories
